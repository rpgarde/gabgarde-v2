### I am versatile and multi-skilled

I am an emerging conservator, currently enrolled in The University of Melbourne's Master of Cultural Materials Conservation program. I am honing my practical skills in conservation, while also developing a deeper understanding of the ethical considerations and standard professional practices in the field.

I am a student member of the Australian Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Material (AICCM), and aspire to be a vocal, proactive advocate for cultural heritage. I am actively engaged in the field, and take opportunities to connect with like-minded professionals and contribute my unique perspectives. I truly have a deep love for history and the arts, and an appreciation and sensitivity for the countless human cultures scattered across different nations and time periods.
